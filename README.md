# perfectArchive

Django based code base for https://theperfectline.info/

This site maintains the archive of game play for the CBS/Game Show Network television show The Perfect Line

Site is a passion project to track statistics based on podium position and player performance

It was also a learning experience for the developer as Google Gemini (2.5 Pro) was used to develop, modify and maintain
the site. Not a single line of code was hand written. The entire project from start to finish is being performed through
prompts before being tested locally and deployed. Even the AWS configuration and deployment procedures were performed
using Gemini advice and instruction.

# ToDo
* Cache data from views somehow?
* Mailing list for analysis updates
